# AdapterMan
AdapterMan for Workerman v3.5

Use almost any PHP app with Workerman, without touch 1 line of code in your fw or app.

If your app or fw use a Front Controller, 99% that will work. Requires minimun PHP 8.0.

Actually working with:
- Symfony
- Laravel
- Yii2
- Slim
- KumbiaHP
- ... (Your app?)

Still testing with more fws and apps.

## Installation
```
composer require adapterman/adapterman
```
Automatically install Workerman too.

## Server
server.php
```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';


use Adapterman\Adapterman;
use Workerman\Worker;

Adapterman::init();

$http_worker                = new Worker('http://0.0.0.0:8080');
$http_worker->count         = (int) shell_exec('nproc') * 4;
$http_worker->name          = 'AdapterMan';

$http_worker->onWorkerStart = function () {
    //init();
    require __DIR__.'/start.php';
};

$http_worker->onMessage = static function ($connection, $request) {

    $connection->send(run());
};

Worker::runAll();

```
