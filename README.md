# AdapterMan
AdapterMan for Workerman v3.5

Use almost any PHP app with Workerman, without touch 1 line of code in your fw or app.

If your app or fw use a Front Controller, 99% that will work. Requires minimun PHP 8.0.

Actually working with:
- Symfony
- Laravel
- Yii2
- Slim
- KumbiaHP
- ... (Your app?)

Still testing with more fws and apps.
